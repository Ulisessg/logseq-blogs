- Mariadb is a open source database
- ## Install Mariadb
	- Given Debian stable does not provide the latest versions of most software we must set the Mariadb source to download the proper version
	- Firs we must generate the proper repo info in the mariadb page https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config
	- Import gpg keys
	- ```sh
	  ```
